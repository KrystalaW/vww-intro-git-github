# Intro to Git and GitHub
Presentation and supporting assets for the Vermont Works for Women SUIT Intro to Git and GitHub workshop

## What is Git?

Git is an open-source, **distributed** **version control system**.

A *version control system* allows you to keep track of changes to documents, making collaboration easy. *Distributed*, in this case, means that each user has a copy of the repository on their own computer that syncs with a remote server only when you're ready for it to do so. This makes changing files and storing them fast and provides numerous backups since every user has a copy on their own machine.

The distributed aspect (and its advantages) is one major difference between Git and the version control systems that came before it (such as CVS and Subversion), and one of the main reasons it has grown to be one of the most common version control systems in use today.

Version control systmes are widely used for things involving code, but you can version control images, documents, and any number of file types.

## What is GitHub?

At its most basic, GitHub is a web-based hosting service for Git **repositories** (think of a *repository* as a project, or collection of your files). But, GitHub is also part-social-network (for developers); part-all-in-one bug tracking tool; part-open-source-facilitator (everyone can see your code and can edit it if you allow it); and much more.

GitHub also allows you to host basic websites directly from your repositories. This is how we manage the Vermont Works for Women SUIT page.

For this workshop, we've installed GitHub’s desktop application for Git, so the difference between Git and GitHub may seem blurry. If it helps keep things straight in your head, the things we do in the desktop application are Git things—we could do them through the command line as well, and they are all about version control. Things we do through the browser will be unique to GitHub, and will focus more on collaborating with the world outside your project.

## Git Basics

### Initialize a Repo

### Status

### Add files
- staging

### Commit
- hashes

### Log


### Branches
-gh-pages

### Merges

## Collaboration

### Setting up remotes

### Forking

### Pull Requests

## Lab Time

- Fix one typo in this presentation and submit a pull request
- Create your own repository with a README.md and push to github
- Find something interesting, fork it, check out your fork locally

## Resources

[Git-scm.com](http://git-scm.com/) is the homepage of the Git project, that will direct you to many resources, GUIs, downloads, etc. 

[Try Git](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) is a free introduction to Git that allows you to try the basic commands directly in your browser, thanks to Code School.

[Pro Git](http://git-scm.com/book/) by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub is available for free online. It's very comprehensive, and a go-to resource.
